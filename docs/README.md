# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management process documentation! This folder contains all the guides, templates, and best practices we use to deliver successful projects.

## Purpose

This documentation hub serves as the central resource for understanding how OctoAcme runs projects—from initial idea validation through deployment and continuous improvement. Whether you're a new team member, a project manager coordinating delivery, a product manager defining outcomes, or a developer implementing features, these docs will help you understand your role and how to collaborate effectively.

## Our Approach

OctoAcme's project management methodology is built on the following core principles:

- **Customer-first and value-driven delivery** — We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative, incremental planning and execution** — We deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear roles and ownership** — Each project has defined roles for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders
- **High transparency** — We use standardized artifacts and maintain a single source of truth for project status
- **Data-informed decisions** — We measure impact and iterate based on evidence and metrics
- **Psychological safety** — We encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement without blame
- **Regular communication cadences** — We maintain consistent alignment through structured meetings and updates

## Documentation by Project Lifecycle

These documents are organized to follow the natural flow of a project from inception to completion:

### 1. Getting Started & Overview

**[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)**  
Start here! This document provides a high-level introduction to OctoAcme's project management approach, core principles, key roles, and essential artifacts. Perfect for new team members or anyone wanting a quick refresher.

**[Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)**  
Understand the responsibilities, goals, and communication patterns for each role: Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers. Use this to clarify expectations and foster effective collaboration.

### 2. Project Initiation

**[Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)**  
Learn how to validate and authorize new work. This guide covers creating a Project One-pager, aligning stakeholders, defining success metrics, and making go/no-go decisions before moving into detailed planning.

### 3. Planning Phase

**[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)**  
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan. This document explains how to break work into shippable increments, create a prioritized backlog, estimate scope, define Definition of Done, and identify dependencies and risks.

### 4. Execution & Delivery

**[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)**  
Guidance for day-to-day execution and progress tracking. Covers team rhythm (standups, demos), workflow management, quality and testing standards, metrics and reporting, and blocker escalation paths.

**[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)**  
Learn how to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks throughout project execution. Includes stakeholder communication templates, status update formats, and escalation paths for issues.

### 5. Release & Deployment

**[Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)**  
Standardized practices for releasing features to production. Covers release types, pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, rollback procedures, and release notes templates to reduce risk and improve observability.

### 6. Continuous Improvement

**[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)**  
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements. Learn how to run effective retrospectives, track improvement action items, and build a culture of continuous learning.

- **Weekly:** PM + Product Manager alignment
- **Weekly:** Risk register and status updates
- **Monthly:** Stakeholder updates and demos
- **Per Sprint/Milestone:** Sprint planning and retrospectives
- **Ad-hoc:** Escalations and incident response as needed

### Key Artifacts

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members

1. **Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** to understand our core principles and approach
2. **Read the [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) guide** to understand your role and how you'll collaborate with others
3. **Familiarize yourself with the project lifecycle documents** (Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective)
4. **Review any project-specific documentation** in your project repository (often in `.copilot/` or the repo README)
5. **Ask questions!** Our culture values psychological safety — there are no silly questions

### For Project Teams

When starting a new project, follow this sequence:

1. Create a Project One-pager using the [Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)
2. Hold a kickoff and create a detailed plan using the [Planning Guide](octoacme-project-planning.md)
3. Execute using practices from [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) and [Risk Management](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)
4. Deploy following the [Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)
5. Run a retrospective using the [Continuous Improvement Guide](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)

### For Copilot Spaces Users

These documents are designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Copilot Spaces:

- Add relevant process docs to your project's `.copilot/` folder to give Copilot context
- Reference specific guides when asking Copilot for help with project management tasks
- Use the persona definitions to frame role-specific guidance from Copilot
